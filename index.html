            <section>
              <p>My father is a retired carpenter who worked full time during the day and then ran his own construction business in the evenings and weekends.
                I worked with him almost everyday for 15 years of my life doing residental construction, primarily kitchens and bathrooms. The following is a loose guide
                for fixing a hole in your drywall. Just like programming there are several methods and tools to get the same end result.

                <h2 align ="center">Site Preparation</h2>
                <p>Inspect the hole and see if there is any plumbing or electrical inside the hole. 
                  Find a dropcloth or towel to catch the debris and dust. A combination or sweeping and a shop vac work best for clean up.

                <h2 align ="center">Installing wood backing</h2>
                <p>Measure your opening and cut a new piece of drywall at least 1/8 inch smaller but no bigger than 1/4. Apply a screw every 4 to 6 inches, with a minimum of 2.</p>

                  <figcaption>be careful not to sink your screws too deep into the drywall. This will cause
                    them to pull through and negate any effect the backing has. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/JH8iiX9.jpg">bpv6ja</a></figcaption>

                    <p>For small projects you can purchase a sanding block in any home improvement store in the drywall section.
                      lightly sand in a circular motion feeling with your hand flat against the wall for any humps or imperfections.
